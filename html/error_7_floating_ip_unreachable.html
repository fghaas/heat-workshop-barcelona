<h2>Error 7: Floating IP unreachable</h2>

<p><strong>Error</strong></p>

<p><em>Pings or SSH to floating IP address time out</em></p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Create a security group that allows inbound traffic (default is to block everything).</p>

<p><em>Partial:</em> <code>partial09.yaml</code></p>

<!--
The problem is fairly simple: OpenStack's default security group blocks all
inbound traffic and you need to whitelist the traffic you want to get through
to your instances. You do that by creating a security group with rules
permitting your desired traffic.

Again, a Heat template somebody downloads from the Internet may make
assumptions: namely, that it runs in an environment where somebody modified the
default security group's rules to allow inbound traffic (which is not a good
idea, but still a fairly common practice).
