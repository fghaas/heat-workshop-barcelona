<h2>Error 5: No valid host was found</h2>

<p><strong>Modified command</strong></p>

<pre><code>heat stack-create --poll -f /tmp/stack.yaml -P flavor m1.ginormous mystack
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Error message</strong></p>

<pre><code>resources.myserver: Went to status ERROR due to "Message: No valid host was
found. There are not enough hosts available., Code: 500"
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Have enough resources available, either by picking a smaller flavor or by
having more/bigger compute nodes.</p>

<p><em>Partial:</em> <code>partial06.yaml</code></p>

<!--
With the key pair problem out of the way we can now abuse the flavor parameter
to cause the next error. Just do the stack-create again but this time please
supply the -P option you see above. We created a special flavour that will not
fit on any of our cloud's compute nodes for the occasion. Unfortunately you
will probably miss out on this if you are using a cloud of your own. This will
cause the flavor value passed on the command line to override the default of
m1.tiny. The value passed on the command line is a bit too large, though so the
nova scheduler will not be able to fit our server anywhere and will report a
failure.

Unfortunately this is a generic Nova error that can occur for a bunch of
other reasons as well: no compute nodes available at all, Neutron agents on
compute nodes being unavailable or throwing errors. But generally it means Nova
or Neutron being unable to instantiate/connect the instance in question. If it
happens it's likely not to be related to the Heat template, with the one
exception of demanding too many resources by requesting a large flavor.
